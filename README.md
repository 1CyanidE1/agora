## What is *agora* ?

*Agora* is system that implements Markowitz Portfolio Optimization method (classical mean-variance technique). 

It is extensible, and can be useful for a casual investor giving initial insights through as a serious *Financial Instrument Analysis* or *Portfolio Management*.

Head over to the [report](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jimmyg1997/NTUA-Multi-Criteria-Decision-Analysis/master/report.pdf) to get an in-depth look at the project.
