## What is *agora* ?

*Agora* is a system that implements Markowitz Portfolio Optimization method (classical mean-variance technique). Harry Markowitz's 1952 paper is the undeniable classic, which turned portfolio optimization from an art into a science. The key insight is that by combining assets with different expected returns and volatilities, one can decide on a mathematically optimal allocation which minimises the risk for a target return â€“ the set of all such optimal portfolios is referred to as the efficient frontier.


It is extensible, and can be useful for a casual investor giving initial insights through as a serious *Financial Instrument Analysis* or *Portfolio Management*. The software relies on Yahoo Finance! to download the most recent trends in asset performance.

## A quick example

Here is an example on real life bond, stock & commodities data, demonstrating how easy it is to find the 2 efficient portfolios:

* One that *Maximises the Sharpe ratio* (a measure of risk-adjusted returns).
* One that *Minimizes the volatility*

```python
./agora.py portfolio-optimiation 5000 5 AAPL MSFT NVDA VRTX BTC-USD 01/01/2015 23/04/2020
```

This outputs the following:

## Source Code
```
/src/agora/agora.py        `Agora` main control used to execute commands
/src/agora/instrument.py   Instrument class that covers methods related to instruments
/src/agora/portfolio.py    Portfolio class that covers methods related to portfolios
/src/agora/utils.py        Every extra useful function in terms of (a) financial calculations (b) User Experience (UI)

```

## ÎœÎ•ÎœÎŸ
* *Instrument*   : An instrument is a financial Security e.g Apple
* *Ticker*       : It is the symbol used in the stock market. APIs used this to retrieve data. eg. AAPl for Apple
* *Portfolio*    : A pool of different instruments that may belong to the same asset class or not
* *Asset Class*  : A grouping of investments that exhibit similar characteristics and are subject to the same laws eg. Stocks, Bonds, Commodities. AAPL belongs to the 'Stocks'
* *Optimization* : For this project is the resolving of the 'Asset Allocation' problem by finding the optimal weights for every one of 2 efficient portfolios
* *Metrics*
  * *Descriptive*   : *Return* (price change of an instrument from day to day) & *Risk* (standard deviation of the changes)
  * *Risk Analysis* : Implementation of CAPM (Capital Asset Pricing Model). Extra *Risk* metrics calculated against a market (Beta, Alpha, R^2). We chose **S&P500** (stock market) as market instrument.


## Future Work

* **Optimization Techniques**
  * *Black Litterman Allocation as optimization technique*
  * *Hierarchical Risk Parity*
* **Machine Learning Techniques**
* **Macroeconomic & Microeconomic Analysis**
  * *Principal Component Analysis (PCA)* : Analyze and keep *N* most valuable features that caputre information about a financial instrument.
  * *Experimental Features* : exponentially-weighted covariance matrices. Etc.
